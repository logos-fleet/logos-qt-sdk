// The Qt <-> lp seam: everything a generated Qt-typed consumer wrapper needs in
// order to be a VENEER over the one transport path instead of a second
// implementation of it.
//
// Background. There used to be two consumer implementations for calling one
// module from another — a Qt-typed one (its own conversion table, its own
// LogosAPIClient calls) and an std-typed `lp` one over the logos-protocol C
// ABI. Two implementations of one behaviour, and the divergences were real:
// the Qt sync and async return tables converted the same type differently, and
// the Qt path had its own idea of how a `result` or a byte string crossed the
// wire. This header exists so the Qt surface can keep its types while its BODY
// is the lp path.
//
// This header is the TRANSPORT half of the seam: one lp client per
// (origin, target) plus the token bridge a Qt plugin needs. The CONVERSION half
// — the only conversion vocabulary a generated wrapper may use — is
// logos_qt_wire.h, included below.

// ── the transport seam ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// One lp client per (origin, target), for the life of the process, plus the
// subscriptions taken out through it.
//
// Two things force this shape, and both are about matching what the Qt wrapper
// already promised:
//
//   LIFETIME. `modules().bind_<iface>(name)` returns a wrapper BY VALUE, and
//   call sites subscribe on that temporary. That worked because the Qt
//   subscription lived on the LogosAPI-owned LogosAPIClient. An lp subscription
//   is an RAII handle that unsubscribes when it dies, so a wrapper owning one
//   by value would stop delivering the moment the temporary went out of scope.
//   Parking client + subscriptions here keeps the wrapper a thin, copyable
//   handle and preserves the existing lifetime contract exactly — a
//   LogosAPIClient obtained from `api->getClient()` is likewise cached for the
//   module's lifetime and never destroyed.
//
//   TOKENS. A Qt module is a plugin, and it links its own copy of the protocol
//   library — so `TokenManager::instance()` inside the plugin is NOT the
//   instance the LogosAPI (constructed in the host image) hands to its clients.
//   The lp client reads the plugin's; the host writes the host's. Without a
//   bridge, every lp call out of a Qt plugin presents an empty auth token,
//   capability_module refuses to mint a per-target token, and the call returns
//   a default value with NO error surfaced. (The cdylib backend never hits this
//   because its glue forwards tokens across the C ABI through
//   `logos_module_accept_token` -> `lp_token_save`; the Qt backend had no such
//   hook.) `syncTokens` is that hook, and it is a hard prerequisite for this
//   whole design, not an optimisation.
class LpBridge {
    // How a bridge mirrors the host's bootstrap tokens into the plugin's own
    // TokenManager, when it has a LogosAPI to read them from. A raw function
    // pointer rather than a std::function so it is trivially atomic (and so the
    // one implementation stays visible in this header).

    // and NULL once that object is gone or when none was ever handed over.
    //
    // Published because the lifetime is the contract, not an implementation
    // detail: a bridge is process-lifetime and a LogosAPI is not, so "which one,
    // and is it still there" is the question a caller (and a test) has to be
    // able to ask. Returns a raw pointer rather than the weak handle — nothing

    // result trampoline collapsed the C ABI's failure form — `ok == 0` with
    // `json` set to the canonical {code, message, origin} object — into a bare
    // JSON null, which is also what a successful call returning nothing
    // delivers. logos-cpp-sdk#142 added LpClient::invokeAsyncResult with
